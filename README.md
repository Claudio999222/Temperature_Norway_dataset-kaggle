# Temperature_Norway_Dataset Kaggle

## Overview

In this notebook, we will work with the Temperature_Norway dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal is to perform data preprocessing, normalize the data, create a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for predicting average temperatures, train the model, and illustrate the training results.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore and preprocess the Temperature_Norway dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the data for training.

2. **Data Normalization**: Normalize the dataset to bring all features to a standard scale, facilitating the training process.

3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture**: Design a CNN architecture suitable for predicting average temperatures. Consider the input shape, convolutional layers, pooling layers, and output layer.

4. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed and normalized dataset. Monitor training metrics such as loss and accuracy.

5. **Results Illustration**: Visualize the training results, including loss and accuracy curves over epochs. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

## Why Temperature Prediction?

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Predicting temperatures is essential for environmental monitoring, weather forecasting, and climate studies.

- **Modeling Complex Patterns**: Convolutional neural networks can capture spatial dependencies in temperature data, making them suitable for this prediction task.

- **Real-world Application**: The ability to predict temperatures has practical applications in various fields, including agriculture, energy management, and urban planning.

This notebook serves as a practical example of using deep learning techniques for temperature prediction on a real-world dataset.
